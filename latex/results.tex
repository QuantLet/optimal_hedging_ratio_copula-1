\section{Results}
We discuss the results in three directions, hedging effectiveness,
ability of hedging extreme negative events in $R^S$, and the stability of $h^*$.

\subsection{Hedging Effectiveness}
The hedging effectiveness(HE) is defined as
\begin{align}
  1- \frac{\rho_\phi(R^h)}{\rho_\phi(R^S)}.
  \end{align}
The hedging effectiveness is the reduction of portfolio risk.
This way of evaluating of hedging performance is proposed by \cite{ederington1979hedging} in the context of, at that time, hedging the newly introduced
organized futures market.
He evaluates the extent of variance reduction by introducing another asset.
We measure the hedging effectiveness also in other risk measure mentioned in section \ref{subsec:spectral-risk-measures},
for example
\begin{align}
  1- \frac{\text{ES}_\alpha(R^h)}{\text{ES}_\alpha(R^S)}.
  \end{align}

The box-plots in figure \ref{fig:OOSHE} show the out-of-sample hedging effectiveness of different copulas under various risk
reduction objectives across testing datasets.
Observe that in most of the copulas perform well in most of the time.
The average HE of copulas and risk reduction objectives is higher than 60\% except for Frank-copula.
However, the HEs vary a lot in different testing data.
In some instances, the HE can be as low as 10\%.
This reflects the highly violate nature of cryptocurrencies:
the optimal hedge ratio in the training data deviates from that of testing data.
There is a large literature about structural break points and time changing dependence, to name a few
\citet{hafner2012dynamic}, \citet{patton2006modelling}, \citet{creal2008general},
\citet{engle2002dynamic}, and \citet{giacomini2009inhomogeneous}.
\citet{manner2012survey} gives a great survey about this issue.
The discussion is out of the scope of this study.\medskip

Frank-copula, in general, is not a good choice to model financial data.

   \label{fig:Frank}
\end{figure}

Aside from the Frank-copula, the HEs of various combination of copula and risk reduction objective are very similar.
This is an expected result as the portfolio consists only two assets.
In addition to hedging effectiveness, we observe the out-of-sample returns of the hedged portfolio.
Figure~\ref{fig:OOSRH} tabulates the time series of out-of-sample returns of hedged portfolio under various copulas and risk reduction objectives.

One can see all the combinations of copula and risk reduction objective generate a large fluctuation of returns in
25/09/2019 and 26/09/2019.
This large fluctuation is due to dependence break.

Figure~\ref{fig:Gumbel} shows the time series of out-of-sample $R^h$ using Gumbel copula with the
objective of reducing variance.
The red dots are the 30 most extreme negative returns in Bitcoin.
In the figure, we can see the downside risk of Bitcoin is well managed by the hedging procedure with Gumbel copula.
Most of the extreme losses of Bitcoin are greatly reduced by introducing the CME future in the hedged portfolio.
Two exceptions are found in 25/09/2019 and 26/09/2019, where the CME future failed to follow the large drop in Bitcoin. (TODO: drop reason)
One of the possible reason is that traders was performing rollover activities on 25-26/09/2019, which
27/09/2019 is the expiry day of the September future.
Another reason for Gumbel fail of capturing the loss is dependence break.
The Kendall's tau in the training data is 0.2 higher than that of the testing data.
Other copulas suffer from the break as well.



\subsection{Stability of $h^*$}
We measure the stability of $h^*$ by sum of absolute change
\begin{align}
    \sum_{t=1}^T|h_t - h_{t-1}|.
    \end{align}

Adjustment of portfolio weights induces price slippage (ref) and transaction cost.
From figure \ref{SAD} we know the NIG factor copula with variance as risk reduction objective generates the smallest
sum of absolute change in OHR.
