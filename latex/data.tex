\section{Data}
Cryptocurrenices are traded around the clock, but CME future are traded from
Sunday to Friday from 05:00 p.m. to 04:00 p.m. U.S. central time.
We match the timestamps and timezones of different data sources.

Hedging Pair 1 is hedging \#1 (Bitcoin Spot) with \#3 (CME future).
The time difference between the two prices is zero.
They are both adjusted to CET time:
\#1 by pandas.Series.dt.tz\_convert; \#3 by retrieving data from Bloomberg Terminal located in Berlin. \medskip

Hedging Pair 2 is hedging \#4 (CRIX) with \#2 (CME future).
We observe \#2 two hours and one hour before \#4 during CST and CDT respectively.
